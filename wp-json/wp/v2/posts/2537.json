One deals with the candidate\u2019s personal or personality attributes, while the other aids the interviewer or interviewers in determining the candidate\u2019s managerial and interpersonal knowledge.<\/p>\n<p id=\"ember677\" class=\"ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph\">The top MBA questions asked during the personal interview round were:<\/p>\n<p id=\"ember678\" class=\"ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph\"><strong>Question 1: Could you please give a quick introduction to yourself? Tell us about yourself in a unique way.<\/strong> <strong>Answer: <\/strong>The subject of how to introduce yourself is one of the most prevalent interview questions. This is an open-ended question.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only if candidates know how and in what tone to respond to the first question do they have a good chance of gaining the interviewer\u2019s trust.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The response should take no more than 2\u20133 minutes, but it should include all relevant information.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Candidates must demonstrate that they are well-informed about themselves and can articulate that knowledge.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p id=\"ember682\" class=\"ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph\"><strong>Question 2: Describe yourself in three words. <\/strong> <strong>Answer:<\/strong> Be succinct in your response and use any three adjectives that best describe you.\u00a0 Be confident enough to provide three captivating words about your personality that will wow the interviewer or the interviewing panel.\u00a0 Instead of being overly simplistic, candidates can use synonyms to discover fascinating words.<\/p>\n<p id=\"ember683\" class=\"ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph\"><strong>Question 3: What have you learned thus far from your failures? <\/strong> <strong>Answer:<\/strong> Recognize that it\u2019s okay to make errors and learn from them. Do not be embarrassed to talk about your failure.\u00a0 Prepare to answer this question, as well as any others connected to failure, because such inquiries are used to assess candidates\u2019 tolerance levels.\u00a0 When addressing or explaining your failure, don\u2019t come across as broken or disappointed.\u00a0 Instead of focusing on what you\u2019ve lost, try to concentrate on what you\u2019ve gained.<\/p>\n<p id=\"ember684\" class=\"ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph\"><strong>Question 4: What are some of the flaws that you\u2019re working on? <\/strong> <strong>Answer:<\/strong> Instead of diving right into your negative attributes, start with something nice.\u00a0Demonstrate to the interviewer how you can channel negative energy.\u00a0 If you opt not to answer this question, it may indicate that you are too shy to address things freely.\u00a0 Concentrate more on how you\u2019re conquering your negative traits and how much extra effort you\u2019re putting in to turn the bad into the good.<\/p>\n<p id=\"ember685\" class=\"ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph\"><strong>Question 5: Do you have any objectives in mind? Goals over the next five or ten years? <\/strong> <strong>Answer:<\/strong> In these types of questions, applicants can state their objectives in detail. Begin with a one-year goal and work your way up to five and ten-year plans. Don\u2019t be hesitant to respond to these questions. People have objectives. Remember APJ Abdul Kalam\u2019s words: \u201cYou must dream before the dream comes true.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p id=\"ember686\" class=\"ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph\"><strong><em>Are you looking for an MBA program? <\/em><\/strong><a class=\"app-aware-link \" href=\"https:\/\/www.careerhike.in\/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\" data-test-app-aware-link=\"\"><strong><em>Visit CareerHike to get admission to the top online universities in India.<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h3 id=\"ember687\" class=\"ember-view\">Top MBA Personal Interview Questions for Managers:<\/h3>\n<p id=\"ember688\" class=\"ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph\"><strong>Question 6: According to you, what is the one managerial trait that all managers must possess? <\/strong> <strong>Answer<\/strong>: Don\u2019t jump to that one attribute right away. List the traits of a manager, such as leadership, communication, decision-making, reliability, and integrity, and then elaborate on the one managerial quality that you believe is the most important. While elaborating about management quality, try to use concise language. Answering this question gives you a chance to talk about something you\u2019re more passionate about.<\/p>\n<p id=\"ember689\" class=\"ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph\"><strong>Question 7. Have you ever demonstrated that you are a good manager? <\/strong> <strong>Answer<\/strong>: Because you are applying for an MBA program, the panel may ask you about a time when you had to act as a manager or accept responsibility for something good during the personal interview stage. Make sure you have a good example to back up your answer.<\/p>\n<p id=\"ember690\" class=\"ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph\"><strong>Question 8. Please elaborate on your achievements. Is there a time when you stood out as a manager and took charge? <\/strong> <strong>Answer<\/strong>: It\u2019s simple to come up with positive attributes or achievements. Some candidates, on the other hand, may find it difficult to put their feelings into words. Answer MBA job interview questions regarding your achievement, its impact on your life, your experience, what you gained from that accomplishment, and so on. Also, discuss the initiatives you took and the lessons you learned along the way.<\/p>\n<p id=\"ember691\" class=\"ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph\"><strong>Question 9: Do you believe you will be unable to work with certain types of people in the future? <\/strong> <strong>Answer<\/strong>: Maintain your composure and answer this question in a fair tone, no matter how desperate you are to answer or disclose the other side of the coin by diminishing any other person or personality. A candidate could wind up showing himself or herself in a negative light as a result of doing so.<\/p>\n<p id=\"ember692\" class=\"ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph\"><strong>Question 10: Elaborate decision-making.<\/strong> <strong>Answer<\/strong>: Study managerial terms and their definitions, and try to draw conclusions from the words ahead of time. This is only an example to demonstrate the importance of managerial words to the candidates. The subject could be anything. Make sure you understand the managerial terms and give a detailed response. You won\u2019t get through the MBA personal interview stage with one-liners.<\/p>\n<p id=\"ember693\" class=\"ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph\"><strong>Advanced Interview Techniques for MBA Personal Interviews <\/strong> If you are scheduled for a personal interview, basic etiquette such as formal attire, punctuality, and hygiene are required.
